## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Which programming languages are the most desired next year (Which language to learn in 2021)?
2. Which programming languages are the most popular among developers in 2020?
3. How much more do developers earn for mastering certain programming languages?

The full set of data can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Part 1 of the file focuses on creating the bar chart for the most popular languages in 2020 and 2021 based on the answers from Stack Overflow developers. Part 2 of the file implements a simple linear regression to investigate how much more can developers earn knowing certain programming langauge. Furthermore, the markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium post available [here](https://medium.com/p/a106e34d9ea3/edit).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

All credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
